**1. Log into ieng6** 

I wrote `ssh agybarra@ieng6` then `<enter>` to log into the ieng6.

First I forked the repository. I then copied the SSH URL and typed 
`git clone git@github.com:agybarra/lab7.git` then I hit `<enter>`

**3. Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail**
4. Edit the code file to fix the failing test
5. Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed
6. Commit and push the resulting change to your Github account (you can pick any commit message!)
