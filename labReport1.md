## Lab Report 1

**In each screenshot I used the pwd command to show the working directory but I will also add it below each image**
1. `cd` with *no* arguments

* When running the commad `cd` with no arguments, the working directory will change to `/home`. The output is not an error and it is a way to change the directory to `/home`. This output is not an error.

2. `cd` with a path to a *directory*

* When running the `cd` command with a path to a *directory*, the working directory is `lecture1`. The output is nothing but the working directory is changed from `/home` to `lecture1`, which alligns with the purpose of the cd command. The output is not an error.

  3. `cd` with a path to a *file*

  * When running the `cd` command with a path to a *file*, the working directory is still `lecture1`. This output occurs because a file is not a directory and thus does not work with the `cd` command. Since the file used is not considered a directory, there is an error thrown.
 
4. `ls` with *no* arguments

* When running the `ls` command with no arguments, the working directory is `lecture1`. The output lists all of the files or directories in the lecture1 foler. The "messages" part of the output is blue and bold since it is a directory and not a file. This output is not an error.
